# eatbeercrawl
EatBeerCrawl answers the age old question of "Where should we go?" and then answers the later question of "Where should we go next?"

Users of Eat Beer Crawl will login with Google OAuth. They will then select their location, how many places they would like to go and the type of entertainment they would like to enjoy. EatBeerCrawl will then genrate a random Crawl for theb user based on location and type of entertainment they are looking for.
